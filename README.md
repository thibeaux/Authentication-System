# Authentication-System
Simple authenication system made in java that uses MD5 hash to test the entered input and compare its hash to the existing files hash. I learned the basics of java programming and I wanted to showcase my knowledge of the lagnuage by adding inheritance to the program and so that is why the program may look weird. It was one of my first programming classes but I have grown from this experience. But I do feel this show cases my knowldege of working with classes and inheritance with java well.
